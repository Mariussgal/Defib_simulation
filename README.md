# Defibrillator Simulator - Online Training Platform


## üè• Project Context

This app was developed during a 2-month internship in the Emergency Department at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris). The project was technically overseen by Marc Dinh (Engineering School Professor) ans under the medical supervision of Dr. Sami Ellouze (Emergency Physician). The goal was creating an accessible online training platform for defibrillation techniques.

## üéØ Project Overview

### Version 1 (Current) - Public Training Platform
The current version offers **free access** to realistic defibrillator simulation scenarios, designed for:
- **Medical students**
- **Healthcare professionals** 
- **General public**
- **Emergency response teams**

Users can practice essential defibrillation skills through authentic hospital scenarios in a safe, controlled environment available 24/7.

### Version 2 (In Development) - Professional Training Suite
The upcoming version will feature:
- **Real-time connectivity** with physical training mannequins
- **Advanced vital signs monitoring**
- **Targeted training** for hospital staff to enhance emergency response efficiency

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Multiple Operating Modes
- **AED Mode (DAE)** - Automated External Defibrillator with voice guidance
- **Manual Mode** - Professional manual defibrillation
- **Monitor Mode** - ECG rhythm monitoring and analysis
- **Stimulator Mode** - Cardiac pacing 

### üìä Realistic Medical Scenarios
- **Ventricular Fibrillation** - Emergency defibrillation with manual defibrillator
- **AED Training** - Automated external defibrillator operation
- **Cardiac Pacing** - Emergency pacing for heart blocks
- **Cardioversion** - Synchronized cardioversion for arrhythmias

### ü´Ä Authentic ECG Rhythms
- Real-time ECG display with authentic cardiac rhythms
- Multiple rhythm types: Sinus rhythm, VF, VT, Asystole
- Dynamic rhythm changes during scenarios
- Professional-grade waveform rendering

### üéÆ Interactive Interface
- Realistic defibrillator control panel
- Rotary knobs for energy selection
- LED indicators and status displays
- Audio feedback and voice instructions
- Electrode placement validation
